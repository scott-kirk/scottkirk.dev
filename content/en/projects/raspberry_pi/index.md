&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little circuit board is a self hosted Linux server that is powering the website you're looking at right now. It runs all of my home services like a docker registry and file store. Modern software development can feel like a lot like 'plug and chug' from Elementary, in terms of of how many projects rely libraries which rely on their own libraries and so forth, making it difficult to control something from the ground up. Building a home server with a Raspberry Pi gave me the opportunity to build my own infrastructure with as much fine tuning as I wanted, at my own pace and for my own learning. In one weekend I was able to build out a headless server that would update public DNS records with its own dynamic IP, in order to host my personal web pages with TLS encryption and secure SSH access.
