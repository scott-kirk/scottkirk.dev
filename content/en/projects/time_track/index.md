Time Track is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) application designed to help someone track how much time they spend on various
activities. I wanted to get a feel for cross-platform app development and I ended up going with the Google's Flutter framework
on top of [Dart](https://dart.dev/) since I've grown to appreciate Google's other language [GoLang](https://golang.org/) so much.
The project still needs a lot more development time but it can currently handle tracking arbitrary activies that the user specifies,
storing it all in a local database. I've also added reporting on the activity data but the only built-in report available right now
is just a summary of the total time spent on the activity, so I hope to add a lot more analytics in the future. The app can be currently
used on both Android and iOS, though I'm waiting to develop it a bit more before publishing it on any app stores. The source for the project
can be found on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/scott-kirk/time_track).
