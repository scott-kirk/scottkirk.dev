&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since graduating from the University of Virginia in 2018, I have been working on highly available backend systems. I primarily focus on an [in-memory database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_(programming_language)) management service, but also orchestrate and maintain [ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) and [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) clusters. Most recently I have been deep diving into [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) through overhauling legacy bash infrastructure into [operator-controlled](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) cluster resources. [Site Reliability Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering) is also a daily focus, whether it be through implementing automated systems that catch critical flaws before customers are affected, or just being a phone call away to remediate anything during our 24/7 operations.
