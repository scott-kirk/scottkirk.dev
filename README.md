This is the source for my personal website that can be found at
https://scottkirk.dev

The awesome [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/) is used to vastly
beautify the website and the personal content is just simple markdown
files in the `content` directory. I build and deploy this site on a
self-hosted Raspberry Pi.
